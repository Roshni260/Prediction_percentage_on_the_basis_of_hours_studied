# Prediction_percentage_on_the_basis_of_hours_studied

## Hello üòä
### Here is the code provided for predicting percentage of a student on the basis of number of hours the student has studied

I have used Linear Regression (Machine Learning Algorithm) for prediction. This is a Supervised Algorithm.Linear regression quantifies the relationship between one or more predictor variable(s) and one outcome variable

Dataset used : https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AdiPersonalWorks/Random/master/student_scores%20-%20student_scores.csv
